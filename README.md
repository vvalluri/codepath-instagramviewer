Assignment 1
Build a read-only photo viewer for Instagram which allows a user to check out popular photos.

User Stories completed:
======================

1. User can scroll through current popular photos from Instagram
2. For each photo displayed, user can see the following details:
    a) Graphic, Caption, Username
    b) Relative timestamp, like count, user profile image (circular)

3. Advanced: Added pull-to-refresh for popular stream with SwipeRefreshLayout
4. Advanced: Shows latest 2 comments for each photo
5. Advanced: Displayed each photo with the same style and proportions as the real Instagram (tried my best :-))
